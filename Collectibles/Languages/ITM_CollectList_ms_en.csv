Book of Death and Rebirth
"A gourd-like vegetable encased in a black[ST:n ]rind. The spongy, white insides have no[ST:n ]taste at all, and are mostly used as a[ST:n ]source of various vitamins."
"A teardrop-shaped potato found in[ST:n ]Primordia. Extremely bitter, it's unsuited[ST:n ]for direct use in food, but is often used[ST:n ]as a source of protein in processed foods."
"A heat-emitting lettuce whose flickering[ST:n ]leaves resemble the sun. Oddly prone to[ST:n ]self-combustion, it can only be found on[ST:n ]rainy days."
"Its fine strands make a furball shape,[ST:n ]while its colorful hue promises a taste[ST:n ]far more exotic than the humble cabbage[ST:n ]it resembles."
"A carrot that splits into eight roots. Seven[ST:n ]of these are ultra sweet, while the[ST:n ]remaining one takes on a bitterness that[ST:n ]makes even the most stoic eyes water."
"A tomato that is able to hold impressive[ST:n ]amounts of water. It appears only on[ST:n ]rainy days, when its juicy flesh is enjoyed[ST:n ]by many local indigens."
This fungus from Noctilum releases spores[ST:n ]that send nearby creatures into a daze.[ST:n ]Its subspecies imparts a bliss-like state on[ST:n ]all who consume it.
"A sweet, tough eggplant that grows from[ST:n ]trees and absorbs their sap. It also draws[ST:n ]out pathogens from within the tree,[ST:n ]thus increasing the life of its parent."
"A plant with seemingly self-aware mouthed[ST:n ]tendrils that extend outwards to hunt[ST:n ]nearby insects. Rich in protein, they are[ST:n ]in turn a source of nourishment for others."
Flora that grows by absorbing plasma[ST:n ]from the surrounding atmosphere. Its deep[ST:n ]taste and numbing effects are coveted[ST:n ]by chefs and foodies everywhere.
"A subspecies of the caseras mushroom,[ST:n ]which only appears once every 100 years.[ST:n ]Those who taste it are said to live out[ST:n ]their days in a pure, bliss-like state."
A vegetable that takes like cabbage.[ST:n ]It sports an odd blackish tint that only[ST:n ]intensifies when boiled.
"A root with a tapered horn shape that[ST:n ]requires thick gloves for proper handling.[ST:n ]Eating it grants superb recovery[ST:n ]properties, but also horrific breath."
"A thick casing houses multiple fist-sized[ST:n ]beans. Eating just one provides a day's[ST:n ]worth of nourishment, making them ideal[ST:n ]for long journeys."
"A new gourd that arrived with an alien[ST:n ]race. Despite its bland taste, its ability to[ST:n ]grow in the most sterile of land makes it[ST:n ]an invaluable foodstuff."
"A pepper that flashes red, yellow, blue,[ST:n ]and then black in a continuous sequence.[ST:n ]It's a feast for both the eyes and the[ST:n ]stomach."
A magnetically charged grass covered in[ST:n ]iron dust. Its ability to remove excess iron[ST:n ]from the body upon digestion makes it[ST:n ]a widely used herbal remedy.
A crown-shaped broccoli that is said to[ST:n ]bestow the lordship of Mira to those who[ST:n ]eat it. Tests indicate that consumption[ST:n ]does indeed lead to feelings of grandeur.
"A radish with interlocking roots that[ST:n ]resemble the DNA double helix.[ST:n ]Its grand appearance is sadly not matched[ST:n ]by its lame, radish-y taste."
"Beans that increase the effects of alcohol,[ST:n ]often leading to dangerous results.[ST:n ]Drinkers are advised to find a different[ST:n ]bar snack if at all possible."
The casing of this plant contains seeds[ST:n ]finer than a grain of sand. Shaking it[ST:n ]produces a pleasant rhythmic sound that[ST:n ]is sure to calm moods and relieve stress.
"A blue-white crop with an appearance[ST:n ]similar to corn. As the plant grows,[ST:n ]its seeds fill with gas before finally[ST:n ]detaching and drifting away on the wind."
A rare type of celery that arises only from[ST:n ]the crevices of deceased fauna soaked by[ST:n ]incessant rain. Its taste depends entirely[ST:n ]on the type of carcass from which it grew.
"Peeling this onion's skin reveals an[ST:n ]inedible middle. The subtly sweet taste of[ST:n ]the outer layers, however, is something[ST:n ]to be savored."
"A chili pepper infused with the energy of[ST:n ]lightning, guaranteed to bring even the[ST:n ]strongest to their knees. It's more at home[ST:n ]in the arms industry than a kitchen."
"This may look like a tree, but it feels and[ST:n ]tastes like bamboo. The fiercer indigens of[ST:n ]Cauldros often use its outer cap to polish[ST:n ]their fangs and tusks."
"A poisonous black root that can kill even[ST:n ]the largest of creatures. If left unchecked,[ST:n ]it eventually ends its own existence as[ST:n ]deadly toxins spread throughout its cells."
"Its transparent skin encases a jelly like[ST:n ]granulated fruit. The juice may be sweet,[ST:n ]but it is also extremely sticky and a real[ST:n ]chore to clean. Handle with care!"
"An orange easily mistaken for a rock. It [ST:n ]may have a soft and sumptuous taste,[ST:n ]but many find it hard to look past its[ST:n ]rather unappealing appearance."
"A fruit that looks like a burdock,[ST:n ]but tastes like a strawberry. It usually[ST:n ]undergoes processing into a strawberry[ST:n ]form in order to please a picky public."
"Beneath the black skin lies a seed that[ST:n ]sparkles like a star, but also finds itself[ST:n ]primed to go supernova. Sadly, removing[ST:n ]the seed causes the fruit it to lose its[ST:n ]trademark glow."
"Ingestion may cause feelings of euphoria,[ST:n ]with side effects including chest thumping[ST:n ]and shrieks of joy. However, its intense[ST:n ]spice should be taken into consideration."
An ultrasonic lemon whose calls are out[ST:n ]of human hearing range. Miran natives[ST:n ]who pick up on its wails can often be[ST:n ]found desperately seeking out the source.
A palm-sized fruit that grows wild in the[ST:n ]woods of Noctilum. Continued exposure to[ST:n ]the sun's rays will dissolve the skin and [ST:n ]reveal the flesh within.
"Upon ripening, this fruit will dislodge[ST:n ]itself from the tree and fall to the ground,[ST:n ]causing serious injury to any unfortunate[ST:n ]enough to be in the way."
"An unusually broad-leaved and sturdy[ST:n ]plant that aggressively propagates itself,[ST:n ]shoving aside other plants and even rocks[ST:n ]as it grows."
"A luminescent fruit that grows within the[ST:n ]giant flowers of Noctilum. Adorned with[ST:n ]long, sharp thorns, those that fall prey to[ST:n ]its glow usually meet a painful end."
"A fruit with rubberlike elasticity.[ST:n ]Its skin has been used in the clothing [ST:n ]industry, while its sweet, chewy texture[ST:n ]yields a sensation similar to that of gum."
"A sour plum that only grows in dark[ST:n ]caves. Its taste can reduce even the[ST:n ]hardiest of creatures to their knees,[ST:n ]and sends most fleeing in terror."
"A dull looking, banana-flavored leaf. [ST:n ]Although loved by all for its flavor,[ST:n ]its habit of camouflaging itself as just[ST:n ]another leaf makes it a rather rare find."
"A rare, light-emitting melon. Worshiped[ST:n ]since the dawn of time as a sacred fruit,[ST:n ]a single bite of its flesh is said to inspire[ST:n ]enlightenment. ...Or at least a smile."
"Growing only in the stormiest of climes,[ST:n ]at first this fruit looks no different than a[ST:n ]clump of sand. Once it ripens, however,[ST:n ]it takes on the look of a watermelon."
"A fruit so large that only one grows per[ST:n ]tree. Its juice can be mixed with alcohol[ST:n ]to create a palatable, wine-like drink."
"A kiwi with an egg-like shell. This hard[ST:n ]casing acts as a protective shield,[ST:n ]guarding the inner contents against[ST:n ]various Miran insects."
"A fruit covered in sharp thorns and prized[ST:n ]for its blood-clotting effects. The bleeding[ST:n ]its harvest causes, however, means more[ST:n ]than a few are devoured in the field."
"A lack of flesh is made up for by[ST:n ]numerous edible seeds. Although bitter,[ST:n ]they are also quite addictive, causing[ST:n ]eaters to devour them without pause."
"A fruit that captures the surrounding cold[ST:n ]air. So cold as to induce frostbite with a[ST:n ]single touch, it can only be eaten after[ST:n ]being brought to room temperature."
"A fruit that contains white, snowflake-like[ST:n ]seeds. It has a harsh and bitter flavor,[ST:n ]and is often used as a pick-me-up for[ST:n ]those residing in colder climes."
"A grape with patterned, jewellike seeds.[ST:n ]Though for the most part immensely sour,[ST:n ]it is also known to turn sweet on rare[ST:n ]occasions—bringing joy to all who eat it."
"Brimming with energy, this mysterious fruit[ST:n ]is prone to cataclysmic explosion upon[ST:n ]impact. Tread carefully when harvesting."
"A fruit with a meaty taste. Heating brings[ST:n ]about strange anomalies in its flavor,[ST:n ]with high temperatures evoking beef,[ST:n ]and low temperatures pork."
"A heat-resistant seed, often found in lava,[ST:n ]that forms into fruit-bearing rock upon[ST:n ]cooling. Though sweet and nutritious,[ST:n ]it remains a tough nut to crack."
"With a skin as tough as iron, this akebi[ST:n ]is well equipped to surviving its harsh[ST:n ]environment. Having existed for countless[ST:n ]millennia, there is doubtless extremely[ST:n ]vital genetic information dormant within."
A fig with strong purification effects that[ST:n ]thrives even in bad soil. So strong are its [ST:n ]effects that it has the ability to diminish[ST:n ]vital nutrition if taken without cause.
A black pineapple dotted with eyelike[ST:n ]reticules. Those who touch it are said to[ST:n ]be sent into a fit of nightmares. Only[ST:n ]recommended for the strong of mind.
"A grass that immediately regenerates[ST:n ]upon being cut. If chopped, each piece[ST:n ]will grow into yet more grass, making[ST:n ]incineration the only proven method of[ST:n ]disposal."
"A white lily that, when bathed in the light[ST:n ]of the moon, emits a faint golden glow.[ST:n ]Drawn towards its bloom, many types of [ST:n ]insect are often found around its flower."
A flower that blooms only for a single[ST:n ]fleeting moment each day before shying[ST:n ]away come nightfall. Its color is truly[ST:n ]magnificent for those lucky enough to[ST:n ]witness it.
An alluring type of grass that has the[ST:n ]power to entrance more than just felines.[ST:n ]Its potent aroma attracts all manner of[ST:n ]wildlife from miles around.
"This dandelion fires its seed at nearby[ST:n ]wildlife, whereupon the seeds feed[ST:n ]parasitically on their host. Accordingly,[ST:n ]the life of the host is rarely long."
"An herb with a sweet, fresh, and relaxing[ST:n ]aroma. Even the most lively of creatures[ST:n ]is said to be calmed by the scent."
"Although this plant grows throughout the[ST:n ]land, its large seed often sprouts in[ST:n ]narrow crevices, resulting in it becoming[ST:n ]blocked off. It's considered an endangered[ST:n ]species as a result."
"A white flower with a modest bloom.[ST:n ]Its height is unremarkable, as is its[ST:n ]appearance. Yet once uprooted,[ST:n ]it shines with an almost divine light."
"A short flower which, despite its name,[ST:n ]avoids the sunlight at all costs.[ST:n ]Forcing light upon it, however,[ST:n ]will cause it to grow quite tall."
"A plant with a tough, silver-colored flower[ST:n ]that chimes like a bell upon catching the[ST:n ]wind. Its clear tones offer visitors to[ST:n ]Noctilum a brief moment of serenity."
"An insectivorous plant that lures prey into[ST:n ]its jaws with a sweet aroma. These fallen[ST:n ]insects become flecks on the plant's body,[ST:n ]eventually mottling each petal."
"No amount of plucking will stop this[ST:n ]flower's petals from sprouting right back.[ST:n ]It is said that eating it bestows similar[ST:n ]effects, making it popular with the elderly."
A large cosmos plant whose petals move[ST:n ]in response to stimulus. This has led many[ST:n ]to believe that it may possess a certain[ST:n ]degree of sentience.
"A large grass that at first glance looks[ST:n ]like a tree. Contrary to appearances,[ST:n ]however, it is extremely flexible and[ST:n ]surprisingly easy to cut."
"With petals that take on the color of their[ST:n ]surroundings, these flowers can be[ST:n ]inordinately difficult to locate."
"By allowing its flowers to be eaten by[ST:n ]Miran wildlife, this plant is able to[ST:n ]propagate by dispersing its seed via their[ST:n ]excrement."
"Similar to Earth's rocambole plant, but[ST:n ]able to grow at an abnormal daily rate.[ST:n ]This plant is quite short lived, and unable[ST:n ]to proliferate as a result."
This plant contains a unique bitterness[ST:n ]that is coveted among gourmands and[ST:n ]chefs of New LA. Even coffee-type drinks[ST:n ]can be derived from this wonder[ST:n ]ingredient.
An unremarkable grass with emetic[ST:n ]properties that cause those who ingest[ST:n ]it to vomit. It can be used alternatively[ST:n ]as either a medicine or poison.
"A cactus with thorns as soft as the[ST:n ]tentacle of a jellyfish. It is said that if[ST:n ]rotting myuena cacti come into contact[ST:n ]with the rain, they turn into silvery[ST:n ]cactaceous resin."
"A holly with large purple fruit. These fruits[ST:n ]explode upon impact, dispersing their[ST:n ]stores of pollen. Certain creatures find the[ST:n ]smell of this pollen intolerable."
"Glistening leaves sprout from this plant's[ST:n ]long, narrow stem. If blended with saliva,[ST:n ]they produce a viscous liquid that coils[ST:n ]around the throat and restricts breathing."
A flower that emits an explosive sound[ST:n ]when it detects any type of noise nearby.[ST:n ]Stalk it like a ninja unless you want to[ST:n ]be blown to kingdom come.
A plant with a ringed stem that emits a[ST:n ]single soap bubble once a day. These[ST:n ]bubbles carry pollen that gives birth to[ST:n ]the next batch of sese lilies.
A rose with petals that can be used as[ST:n ]dyes—which can then be combined to[ST:n ]form any color on the spectrum. It is said[ST:n ]that these vivid colors will never fade.
"A flower that shines with the beauty of [ST:n ]the finest jewels. As it blooms by stealing[ST:n ]nutrients from other nearby plants, it also[ST:n ]doubles up as a handy weed killer."
"A large pollen-filled flower known for its[ST:n ]rapid expansion. The pollen is unusually[ST:n ]appetizing, making it much sought after[ST:n ]by the Nopon."
"A golden chrysanthemum that grows and[ST:n ]reproduces by drifting on the winds of[ST:n ]Cauldros, absorbing sulfur as it goes.[ST:n ]Just before death, it takes on the form of[ST:n ]a sulfur crystal."
"A hardy plant that refuses to burn even in[ST:n ]the fiery rains of Cauldros. It is, however,[ST:n ]extremely sensitive to cold."
"No wildlife—or species—can resist the[ST:n ]charms of this plant. Harvested almost to[ST:n ]extinction by the ancient Mirans, now it[ST:n ]can only be found deep inside Cauldros."
"Similar in appearance to a lizard—but[ST:n ]almost completely desiccated due to an[ST:n ]inability to store moisture. As such,[ST:n ]it tends to hunt prey with high water[ST:n ]content."
"A small, sleepy, koala-like animal with a[ST:n ]number of wings on its back. These would[ST:n ]be more useful if the animal wasn't so[ST:n ]lazy."
"A squirrel-like creature that uses extremely[ST:n ]sharp teeth to carve a home in caves.[ST:n ]If you venture into their lair, you're bound[ST:n ]to come across their fearsome leader."

A excitable golden fish that is often seen[ST:n ]leaping free of the water. Its taste[ST:n ]resembles that of an Earth sardine.
"A three-eared, gunpowder-eating hare.[ST:n ]Sweeping battlefields of every last spent[ST:n ]bullet, their moniker of \""The Janitor\"" is[ST:n ]apt. Their numbers have recently spiked."
"A large, snail-like, shelled creature.[ST:n ]The shell contains a store of fatty blubber[ST:n ]that is used for sustenance in times of[ST:n ]severe famine."
"A creature that curls into a ball when[ST:n ]attacked, using its rocklike appearance as[ST:n ]camouflage. Burdened by its own weight[ST:n ]as it grows, its final days are reduced to[ST:n ]only the tiniest movements."
A flat fish with a movable eye that allows[ST:n ]it to resemble both a left-eyed and right-[ST:n ]eyed flounder.
"This primate's belly pouch is used to[ST:n ]hoard the many treasures which litter the[ST:n ]forest floor. Fiercely protective, only the[ST:n ]foolish would attempt to challenge it."
"An iguana-like creature with a long,[ST:n ]extendable tongue that it uses as a fishing[ST:n ]rod. The very best hunters go on to[ST:n ]become boss iguari, dividing their species."
"A wild bird with mirrored wings. When[ST:n ]hunted, they use these wings to reflect[ST:n ]the sun's rays, dazzling their pursuers[ST:n ]and granting a brief chance of escape."
"A land-roaming jellyfish with a soft,[ST:n ]translucent body. Moving using its many[ST:n ]tentacles, it wraps itself around its prey[ST:n ]before absorbing them into its body."
A small kangaroo-type creature able to[ST:n ]leap many miles in a single jump. Its poor[ST:n ]sense of direction often leads to it [ST:n ]overshooting its intended target.
A beast with space-distorting camouflage[ST:n ]that allows it to morph into other forms.[ST:n ]Hanging fatty deposits allow it to survive[ST:n ]during lean periods.
"The perfect species of mouse. When faced[ST:n ]with adversity, they form into organized[ST:n ]divisions and overpower their opponent[ST:n ]with sheer numbers."
A land-dwelling octopus-like creature with[ST:n ]eight enormously long legs. Its unusually[ST:n ]low body weight makes it highly likely to[ST:n ]fracture in stiff winds.
"A turtle-like creature that feeds mainly on[ST:n ]the zizi rabbit. Able to fit its entire body[ST:n ]within its shell, it uses rotation to zip[ST:n ]along at astonishing speeds."
"A sea-cucumber-like creature that absorbs[ST:n ]sand into its body for its survival. With [ST:n ]90 percent of its body weight being sand,[ST:n ]it is able to quickly fill in any wounds."
"A small monkey with a featureless face,[ST:n ]it relies on sound and movement to gain[ST:n ]its bearings."
"An exceedingly hairy baboon-like creature.[ST:n ]With a lifespan of less than a week,[ST:n ]maturation and aging are both extremely[ST:n ]rapid."

A small raccoon covered in soft fur that[ST:n ]takes great pleasure in grooming its fellow[ST:n ]creatures. It will even give Skells a scrub[ST:n ]if given the chance.
"A bird covered in mysterious markings.[ST:n ]Intelligent enough to understand language,[ST:n ]it can easily avoid all but the most clever[ST:n ]of predators."
A snake-like reptile that subsists on iron[ST:n ]ore. Its stomach contains mounds of[ST:n ]undigested rocks that are used as bullets[ST:n ]to keep approaching predators at bay.
"A five-eyed, boar-like beast. Despite its[ST:n ]demonic appearance, it is surprisingly[ST:n ]timid—often fleeing in terror at the sight[ST:n ]of the smallest insect."
"A bird resembling the humble Earth goose,[ST:n ]but with an entrancing angelic call.[ST:n ]This good-natured bird will use its voice[ST:n ]to guide others out of harm's way."
"A fox-like creature that draws nutrition[ST:n ]from lava. Any other liquid will result in[ST:n ]instant death, so their numbers tend to[ST:n ]fall considerably after heavy downpours."
A rare species only found in Cauldros.[ST:n ]At first glance it may be mistaken for a[ST:n ]wolf—though its fearsome ruby eyes can[ST:n ]be seen for miles.
What looks like a small rubber ball flying[ST:n ]through the air is in fact a mosquito.[ST:n ]Its countless hair-covered mouths draw [ST:n ]blood from a whole host of creatures.
"A locust that uses its retractable antennae[ST:n ]to gather food. It lacks the jumping ability[ST:n ]of its Earth namesake, instead using its[ST:n ]legs to drag itself around."
A foot-long beetle with horns far tougher[ST:n ]than those of its Earth namesake.[ST:n ]It's usually able to take on any attackers[ST:n ]who dare to challenge it.
"An insect that looks like a ladybug.[ST:n ]Its spots increase in number as it ages,[ST:n ]until it becomes fully black in its final[ST:n ]years. It has an odd hatred for music,[ST:n ]and will flee at the first note of a song."
A beetle-like insect that uses meteor shock[ST:n ]waves as sustenance. It is able to[ST:n ]instinctively seek out and locate potential[ST:n ]landing zones prior to any meteorfall.
"Solitary ants that wander across Mira[ST:n ]seeking out their next home. Parenthood[ST:n ]is a brief affair, with barely a day's rest[ST:n ]before resuming their journey."
"A fist-shaped springtail whose poison[ST:n ]grows in potency with each day. In times[ST:n ]of health their shell appears pink, though[ST:n ]it completely bleaches out upon death."
"A luminescent dragonfly from Noctilum.[ST:n ]To attract females, the male radiates in a[ST:n ]spectacular light show that signals the[ST:n ]beginning of courtship."
"A light-emitting horsefly. The more blood[ST:n ]it drinks, the brighter and wilder it gets.[ST:n ]Even a single glimpse of its strobe sends[ST:n ]the doragaroos of Oblivia fleeing."
"A moth that makes its own way in life.[ST:n ]However, in amorous times, pairs can be[ST:n ]seen rushing through their courtship dance[ST:n ]as if their lives depended on it."
"A hairy insect with a falciform front limb.[ST:n ]With a higher proportion of females[ST:n ]to males, many an epic battle takes place[ST:n ]as females seek to secure a mate."
