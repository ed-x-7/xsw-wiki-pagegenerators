up sales, or else lazy helper will

ITM_INFO_161_Caption,171,"I spotted a new Sylooth at the Silent Stream

position. Damn you, Ganglion! Is there no end
to your military resources?!"
ITM_INFO_162_Caption,171,"We finally found the trail of the team that
went ahead of us into the depths of Noctilum.
Seems they nearly made it to the heart of the
forest, but all that was left of them was debris."
ITM_INFO_163_Caption,171,"I hear a Skell was destroyed by a primordial
creature in the Elephant's Trunk area of
Noctilum. No one was killed, thankfully,
but what a tragic waste of a critical resource."
ITM_INFO_164_Caption,171,"Do you possess any information about the
strange tree near Noctilum's Bident Crossing?
For some reason, it makes my Ovah
throb whenever I look upon it."

landed near the Ensconced Citadel. But how
on Earth are we supposed to recover it?!"
ITM_INFO_166_Caption,171,"I heard they found Skell wreckage in
Noctilum's Middle Hushflood. But it's
probably not the one my brother was
piloting..."
ITM_INFO_167_Caption,171,"You saw a plant-like indigen aggressively
circling the skies over Noctilum's Everwhelm
Falls? Hmm... I wonder if it was a tyrant?"
ITM_INFO_168_Caption,171,"You had a ""memory"" of seeing wreckage of
an alien civilization in Noctilum's Qing Long
Glade? Did you actually see it, or just sense it
with that Ovah-whatever thing you do?"
ITM_INFO_169_Caption,171,"Be careful when traveling along Fukai Pass.
It appears to be insidia territory.
There's one of them in particular that's
unusually tough and tenacious."

smash to death! Then cook! Then eat!"
ITM_INFO_172_Caption,171,"My friend surveying Noctilum found a
virago nest in the deepest part of
Rockmole's Burrow but was too scared
to get anywhere near the thing."
ITM_INFO_173_Caption,171,"A trailer loaded with precious resources was
attacked at Noctilum's Decapotamon.
Just goes to show how dangerous it is to
be out there without a Skell."
ITM_INFO_174_Caption,171,"I found an unexplored territory past the
Canopied Nightwood, but before I could
enjoy it, a strong tyrant camouflaged as a

Elephant's Trunk. I hope the crew is safe, but
with all the indigens out there, it's hard to

Er, unless you're in a Skell or something."
ITM_INFO_177_Caption,171,"An alien container was found near the
Rustpool Banks in Noctilum."
ITM_INFO_178_Caption,171,"There's a tyrant in the Rustpool Banks.
I hear it's a scirpo, so it's one of those
spider-type things. I pray I never have to
see it for myself! I simply can't stand bugs."
ITM_INFO_179_Caption,171,"I saw this crazy tree that looks like a giant
dragon's tail in Noctilum. I can't get it out
of my head! Could someone please investigate
it for me, maybe?"

Lake Basel in Oblivia. Maybe it contains
treasure?"

the North Coast. I doubt he'll be much

look out for him all the same."

Clever Earth aliens might find something there."
ITM_INFO_207_Caption,171,"The wrecked Skell on North Coast? Yeah, that

first mission out here and barely managed to
escape with my life."
ITM_INFO_208_Caption,171,"I heard voice of oracle from fountain!
It spoke of broken oc-serv on North Coast
in Oblivia."
ITM_INFO_209_Caption,171,"I recall hearing a report that a human-made
Skell had been shot down near King's Falls.
Shouldn't you recover that? Mmm?
Or am I out of line suggesting so?"
ITM_INFO_210_Caption,171,"Near Oblivia's Lake Basel, there's a mephite

part of Lake Basel. Stop leaving trash near
Nopon territory!"
ITM_INFO_212_Caption,171,"The Nopon at Oblivia's Lake Basel think the

filthy?! Go do it for all humankind's sake!"
ITM_INFO_217_Caption,171,"I heard the Reclaimers found wreckage from 
the White Whale at the entrance to Oblivia.
They haven't done any actual reclaiming yet,
but hopefully they find something useful."
ITM_INFO_218_Caption,171,"There's a large suid sow that naps right in the
middle of the road near here. I don't think you
want to mess with her if you can avoid it, so
don't wake mommy, okay?"
ITM_INFO_219_Caption,171,"You found a wrecked vehicle at Oblivia's Twin
Arches? Well, it doesn't look like I'll be back

handle it."

I was almost eaten by a giant mortifole that
lives on top of the Twin Arches..."

good money it's a hardened veteran."

a little bit creepy, you know?"

Best to leave the recovery of that sort of thing

even a Skell is no guarantee of safety."

there are tectinsulas that go for years without
food or water. Pretty stoic, right?"
ITM_INFO_238_Caption,171,"I've heard rumors of creepy flowers blooming

I'd go kill her myself!"

This could be what we've been waiting for.
We gotta go retrieve that wreckage!"

Leaning Ring in Oblivia. But my observational

North Cinderdunes. I sure hope they're able

to be wreckage from an alien civilization in
the northwestern part of this area. But I doubt
my team is equipped to recover it."

looked like it had been captured by the
Ganglion. Time to gear up and take it out!"

they found wreckage there of a helicopter that

get close enough to survey it properly."
ITM_INFO_263_Caption,171,"Fellow Nopon in Sylvalum was attacked by

alien container that was discovered at Badr
Basin in Sylvalum? SERIOUSLY?
You have the strangest conditions..."

We found a container from an alien
civilization at the South Cinderdunes,
but we couldn't open it."

If she sees you fighting sabulas near the

come after you!"

South Silent Sandsea? Nopon could make
tons of money selling it to humans!"
ITM_INFO_268_Caption,171,"So so I saw an alien container near the
Delusian Mountains. But I figured it was
probably full of junk and stuff, so I just...
left it alone?"
ITM_INFO_269_Caption,171,"I discovered an alien container in North
Hardheart Canyon. If we could recover it
and analyze its contents, I bet it could be
of some use to humanity."
ITM_INFO_270_Caption,171,"There's a large pack of indigens in the vicinity
of the Shivering Sands. We suspect the
monoceros that leads them is a tyrant."
ITM_INFO_271_Caption,171,"So I heard there's a strange petrified tree in
the South Cinderdunes in Sylvalum?
This sounds like a job for the universe's
greatest treasure hunter! ...Which is, er, me?"
ITM_INFO_272_Caption,171,"You know that alien wreckage in the southern
part of the Silent Sandsea? Well, it seems
those sluggards in the lower base camp still
haven't gotten around to salvaging it."
ITM_INFO_273_Caption,171,"We discovered an alien container in the dunes
to the west of Lake Ciel in Sylvalum. Perhaps
the humans can make better sense of it than
we Wrothians could?"
ITM_INFO_274_Caption,171,"There's a reliquary from an alien civilization at
the South Ciel Sandsea, but it doesn't look

What sort of beings used to live there?"

patrols the skies above the northwest part of
Lake Ciel in Sylvalum? Let's hope the humans
bring it down fast, right?"
ITM_INFO_276_Caption,171,"I hear the aggressive aetrygon in Sylvalum are

Lake Ciel. It suddenly start moving and
scare wits from poor friendpon!"

the southern Delusian Mountain foothills?
Forget that and dance! No duty now!
There is only THE DAAAAAANCE!"
ITM_INFO_280_Caption,171,"I saw something I'd never seen before rolling
around the Sylvalum Searoad. I think it was

ITM_INFO_281_Caption,171,"I hear a massive indigen that no one's ever
seen before lives in the western part of
Sylvalum's Lake Ciel. I wonder if our weapons
would even be effective against such a thing?"
ITM_INFO_282_Caption,171,"Apparently, an artifact from an alien culture has
been discovered at Lake Ciel in Sylvalum.
It's a pretty enormous lake, so I guess it's
no wonder we hadn't found it before..."
ITM_INFO_283_Caption,171,"The massive indigens east of Lake Ciel seem
to grow violent when crimson auroras occur.
It's important to pay attention to how the
weather affects such primordial creatures."
ITM_INFO_284_Caption,171,"Really? You came all the way back from
Sylvalum to look for a fighter who might
recover the alien reliquary east of Lake Ciel?
Er, well, good luck with that..."
ITM_INFO_285_Caption,171,"Did you know there's a whole 'nother continent
north of New LA? They say there's these giant
petrified-tree things all over the place there,
and that they sometimes have stuff inside..."
ITM_INFO_286_Caption,171,"Friendpon saw nice big turned-to-stone tree
southwest of Lake Ciel, but had too much
cargo to haul it away. Maybe next time."
ITM_INFO_287_Caption,171,"Have you seen the helicopter wreckage in the
Needle Rock Sandsea? It was shot down by
the Hilal Stronghold. One of these days, we're
going to have to go and recover what's left."
ITM_INFO_288_Caption,171,"Be careful when searching beneath the
noctilucent spheres in Sylvalum, okay?
That's where vivohasts like to hide in hopes
of trapping prey."
ITM_INFO_289_Caption,171,"Have you seen that giant indigen at Sylvalum's
Hilal Meadow? We keep our eyes peeled for
that thing every time we pass through there."
ITM_INFO_290_Caption,171,"It seems a really unusual petrified tree was
found in the southeast part of Sylvalum.
Any chance you're going back to take a
closer look?"
ITM_INFO_291_Caption,171,"On the Seabird's Beak of Sylvalum, I saw a
visigel that was significantly stronger than
all of the others. If I'd gotten any closer,
I probably wouldn't be alive to tell the tale!"
ITM_INFO_292_Caption,171,"We've already lost 21 BLADEs to the giant
tyrant of Hilal Meadow. I can barely
comprehend how dangerous that thing must
be. It makes my knees tremble!"
ITM_INFO_293_Caption,171,"We found something near Hilal Meadow

East Ciel Sandsea. As he laugh at
misfortune, Marnuck emerge from inside!
So awkward...er, for friendpon..."
ITM_INFO_295_Caption,171,"Did you see that big petrified tree nearby?
I'd love to survey that, but it's beyond my
physical capabilities. I'll just have to ask the
Reclaimers to do it. *sigh*"
ITM_INFO_296_Caption,171,"I was watching some footage earlier and
noticed some of the Ganglion mechs deployed
along the outer walls of Sylvalum were
destroyed. Seriously!"
ITM_INFO_297_Caption,171,"I wrecked my Skell near Hilal Stronghold. Let

great treasure by south wall..."

Milsaadi that controls insects at the Forgotten
Mining Frigates in Cauldros. He also said that

afield that piece fell—the ship must have
completely disintegrated in midair."
ITM_INFO_303_Caption,171,"I heard they found debris from the White 
Whale on the cliffs of a small island in the
western part of Cauldros, but that recovering
it has proven too difficult."
ITM_INFO_304_Caption,171,"That reminds me... There was a giant
petramand that lived atop the magma waterfall

menace had it existed on our planet."
ITM_INFO_305_Caption,171,"We found wreckage from an alien civilization

With the reward I get for excavating it,
I'm gonna buy you something really special!"

Ganglion's control. But if we could sneak into
their headquarters and steal their supplies..."

Seidr near the Ganglion hangar. The guy
behind the controls must be one of their ace
pilots."
ITM_INFO_311_Caption,171,"There's a hidden treasure in an indigen's nest
in Cauldros's O'rrh Sim castle ruins, right?
Should I get it for the Prone lady who sits

Cauldros's M'gando Gorge."
ITM_INFO_314_Caption,171,"They say there's treasure hidden in an indigen

doubt I could get close enough to find out,
even with my awesome Skell."
ITM_INFO_315_Caption,171,"Did you know about the alien reliquary that

It requires a pretty high level of skill to be
properly investigated, if you're up for it."
ITM_INFO_316_Caption,171,"If you head up this hill, you'll end up in a
meadow known as the Emerian Battlegrounds.
It's even safer over there than it is here,
so feel free to check it out."
ITM_INFO_317_Caption,171,"There are remains of a Skell from an alien

I guess even they had their hands full
protecting themselves from the local indigens."

Cauldros and recover the patrol copter that
crashed in the lava fields!"

Wrothians. I hope we can learn to be so
cordial in our own dealings."

named Bubu is worried about his wife going
missing? That is so so sad..."
ITM_INFO_412_Caption,171,"I hear the wreckage of the Ganglion mechs

ITM_INFO_524_Caption,171,"Holy wow. Did you see Elma at the
water-purification plant that night?!
No, I... I shouldn't say anything more.
I don't want her to get angry at me!"
ITM_INFO_525_Caption,171,"Kirsty has been looking for that new member
of Elma's team near the water-purification
plant. She sure seemed to be excited about
something."
ITM_INFO_526_Caption,171,"Fritz was negotiating with this woman in
Armory Alley, right? Next thing I know,
she walked around the corner and suddenly
turned into a xeno! I saw it with my own eyes!"
ITM_INFO_527_Caption,171,"I saw Mia in the alley behind the residential
district one night, and she was as perky as
ever. Seeing her like that always makes me
feel better."
ITM_INFO_528_Caption,171,"I heard an Orphean broke into Caroline's
house and trashed her yard. It's all anyone's
talking about in the residential district."
ITM_INFO_529_Caption,171,"Phog's been locked in a staring contest with a
cat in Ishmael Hills for I don't know how long.
What is up with that guy? He's the oddest
duck in this city, and that's saying something."
ITM_INFO_530_Caption,171,"Orphean named Kon'luarb in residential district
asks lots of questions about Biahno water-
purification plant. What is he planning?"
ITM_INFO_531_Caption,171,"A lady named Rosie was screaming about
something over by the water-purification plant.
Poor thing must be at the end of her rope.
...Or crazy. Could be that, too."
ITM_INFO_532_Caption,171,"At sunset, I heard dogs barking at Irina
in front of a house near the cathedral.
That woman is just terrible with animals."
ITM_INFO_533_Caption,171,"I saw L staring at a cat over in the residential
district. He was mumbling to himself about
how one might go about eating such a
creature. So, uh, yeah. Lock up your cats."
ITM_INFO_534_Caption,171,"Earth-alien women are strange. Some even
buy big houses and live in them together."
ITM_INFO_535_Caption,171,"Wendy up in Ishmael Hills was complaining
that some Nopon salesman won't leave her
alone. Poor thing!"
ITM_INFO_536_Caption,171,"I hear Secretary Nagi's paying a visit to Team
Elma's quarters at the BLADE barracks. Yep,
that group sure is close with the secretary...
MUST BE NICE!"
ITM_INFO_537_Caption,0,
ITM_INFO_538_Caption,171,"Even Dr. Staccata couldn't find a cure for this
disease. But apparently it will heal up if I visit
Fraisie in the cathedral?"
ITM_INFO_539_Caption,171,"There's an extraordinarily odd Nopon in the
residential district who seems to be casting
some sort of spell. You don't think it's black
magic, do you? Or...blood magic? Eeeep!"
ITM_INFO_540_Caption,171,"There's a woman over at the cathedral in the
residential district who's always preaching that
xenos and humans are equal. No thanks, pal!
Keep me far, far away from that wacko."
ITM_INFO_541_Caption,171,"I heard Letrick is out looking for a congregant
who visited the cathedral while he was out.
He's a diligent man, that one."
ITM_INFO_542_Caption,171,"There's a strange woman hanging out in the
residential-district park. And when I say
strange, I mean TOOOOTALLY WEIRD.
She might not even be from Earth."
ITM_INFO_543_Caption,171,"I saw Hope tending to flowers at the small
park by the cathedral during lunch. Knowing
her, it was probably a favor for someone else."
ITM_INFO_544_Caption,171,"Can we take containers in lower level
of residential district? They might make
nice chairs."
ITM_INFO_545_Caption,171,"Lately, traitors who deny the Ovah have
appeared in our midst. On'tonam in the
residential district is dealing with the situation."
ITM_INFO_546_Caption,171,"That Phoskeran guy has been hanging out in
Ishmael Hills, yelling to everyone about his
newfound obsession with fortune-telling.
...He is one weird Zaruboggan."
ITM_INFO_547_Caption,171,"Even the BLADE emergency supply caches are
sort of badass. See for yourself! There's one
right behind the cathedral in the residential
district."
ITM_INFO_548_Caption,171,"At the guard post in the lower area, I saw
Gwin spend his lunch hour talking to a
newbie friend and looking all grim. He didn't
even eat! I wonder what's going on..."
ITM_INFO_549_Caption,171,"Lately, Irina has been spending her
mornings getting her weapons modified at
that BLADE gathering spot in the hangars."
ITM_INFO_550_Caption,171,"Those Ma-non sure are passionate about
learning! Quiquat has been asking all sorts
of questions about FrontierNav over near one
of the commercial district's storage areas."
ITM_INFO_551_Caption,171,"Who left that busted-up trailer just beyond
Armory Alley? Let's at least reclaim the stuff
inside that thing so it can be moved later!"
ITM_INFO_552_Caption,171,"Hey, you know that Gus guy? I hear he's up
to some real shady business. You ask me,
BLADE would be better off without him
around."
ITM_INFO_553_Caption,171,"I heard there's a Ma-non repairman in the
lower level of the administrative district. He's 
supposed to be really talented, but he doesn't
seem to be enjoying his success much."
ITM_INFO_554_Caption,171,"I've been hearing Cedric grunting away in the
hangars at night. Has someone asked him
to create another ridiculous invention?"
ITM_INFO_555_Caption,171,"I just met Kirsty, the big cheese for all of
FrontierNav! Sounds like she's aiming for
Oblivia next. I love that passion!"
ITM_INFO_556_Caption,171,"That Kirsty woman is always giving my
husband dangerous assignments! She says she
doesn't have enough staff to survey Noctilum,
but who does she think she's kidding?!"
ITM_INFO_557_Caption,171,"There's a BLADE aspirant at the storage area
behind Division Drive who can't get through
basic training. But she refuses to give up,
and poor Walter is about to lose his mind."
ITM_INFO_558_Caption,171,"Did you know Giogion and his friend L are
going to make gadgets and sell them in a
shop? I guess they're looking for a location
in Armory Alley right now..."
ITM_INFO_559_Caption,171,"You noticed a Wrothian atop the BLADE
Tower? That would be Gu Ladha, I imagine.
She usually keeps to herself like that."
ITM_INFO_560_Caption,171,"Muimui at side of BLADE Tower claim to
discover way to get filthy, crazy rich.
What Muimui know? When Muimui know?
MUST LEARN!"
ITM_INFO_561_Caption,171,"I saw Defense Secretary Nagi behind BLADE
Tower, and it looked like he was thinking
hard about something. Working out the
details of our next operation, I guess."
ITM_INFO_562_Caption,171,"When I went to, er...""confer"" with Kirsty, she
told me not to even talk to her because she
was far too busy thinking about Sylvalum.
Can you even BELIEVE that?"
ITM_INFO_563_Caption,171,"In the evenings, I often see Doug standing
in the commercial district parking lot,
staring at a car with a big dumb grin.
I think he finally bought himself one..."
ITM_INFO_564_Caption,171,"You can usually find Frye behind the diner at
night, drunk out of his mind. And he's one
of those mean drunks, so don't get close!"
ITM_INFO_565_Caption,171,"Kirsty was in front of the building across from
the maintenance center, searching for that
new crew member. I wonder what she wants
with [ST:gender p1=him p2=her ]?"
ITM_INFO_566_Caption,171,"I hear there's wreckage from a Ganglion war
machine in the residential district. Apparently
it crashed while trying to land during the
invasion. Want to go check it out?"
ITM_INFO_567_Caption,0,
ITM_INFO_568_Caption,171,"I heard Carl grumbling about something over
at the east gate. I wonder if he's having some
sort of trouble with his assignment?"
ITM_INFO_569_Caption,171,"I just saw Julius in front of the maintenance
center talking with that Orphean—Han'barac
or something. Things seemed rather serious,
judging by the look on Julius's face."
ITM_INFO_570_Caption,171,"I hear Corwin's team is looking for new
members. If you're interested, you should ask
around at the Pathfinders' headquarters."
ITM_INFO_571_Caption,171,"Friend Lin is buying ingredients in commercial
district again. Lucky Tatsu always get to eat
such wonderlicious foods!"
ITM_INFO_572_Caption,171,"Earlier I saw a BLADE lady who seemed to be
in some sort of trouble? But when I asked her
what was wrong, she screamed and ran
to the east gate. Was it something I said?"
ITM_INFO_573_Caption,171,"Do you know that stuck-up jerk, Tobias? 
Lately he seems to be searching for someone.
And whoever that someone is, they have my 
deepest sympathies. Ha!"

running off to the administrative district.
It ain't easy being a mechanic, I tell you..."
ITM_INFO_577_Caption,171,"Apparently there's a group of wounded
Prone soldiers at the east gate.
And they're from the Cavern Clan!
Whatever is going on here?"
ITM_INFO_578_Caption,171,"I hear Zurranik just received a small fortune in
credits from some weird Wrothian. Now he's
up on the Ma-non ship, freaking out about
how many Miralife Cards he can buy."
ITM_INFO_579_Caption,171,"Sounds like Colonel Elma is visiting the
Ma-non ship to further human-xeno relations.
No surprise, since she was a driving force
behind the treaty in the first place."
ITM_INFO_580_Caption,171,"Every night, L gathers a bunch of xenos at the
entry passage to the Ma-non ship. Got no
idea why, but I bet it's to try and sell 'em a
few more bottles of snake oil."
ITM_INFO_581_Caption,171,"Even animals can't seem to get enough of
Hope. I saw a dog playing with her in the
parking lot by the tennis court. It certainly
looked like it was having fun."

ITM_INFO_583_Caption,171,"So my BLADE friend? He went to Oblivia.
Some place called the Dorian Caravan,
I think? And he hasn't come back since.
I really hope he's okay..."
