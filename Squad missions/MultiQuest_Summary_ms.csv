MultiQuestSummary001,153,"You're needed at King's Falls, where a wounded millesaur
is kicking up a storm. Even other indigens are vacating the
area for safety. ...Say, were those vespers among them?"
MultiQuestSummary002,153,
MultiQuestSummary003,153,"This is EXACTLY why I said to be careful! The ruckus at
the Divine Roost woke an especially dangerous indigen
known as a colubrim. You'll need a Skell if you want to
keep your limbs!"
MultiQuestSummary004,153,"We lost contact with the research team we dispatched to
Lake Ciel after they came under fire from unidentified
craft. Get out there and back them up!"
MultiQuestSummary005,153,"Someone claiming to be a mercenary warlord heard about
how you took out grexes and scintimures, and now wants
to take you on in fair combat. Don't pass this up!"
MultiQuestSummary006,153,"We found what the indigens you took out earlier were so
afraid of—there's a massive ether signature coming from
near the mission area. You'd better head there in a Skell."
MultiQuestSummary007,153,
MultiQuestSummary008,153,"We've confirmed visual contact of a new enemy fighter,
and now we need you to glean data by engaging the
target. Of course, if you want to defeat it, too, we
certainly won't stand in your way!"
MultiQuestSummary009,153,"Seidr threat neutralized. Good wor— What the?! Alert!
Something extremely fast and powerful has just exited a
Ganglion outpost—it's moving in at six times normal
cruise velocity! We need you to intercept now!"
MultiQuestSummary010,153,"We have a sabula problem we need you to take care of
ASAP. It seems a renegade oc-serv jolted the creature
awake, and now, it's not very happy. Keep your eyes
peeled for sneak attacks from below."
MultiQuestSummary011,153,
MultiQuestSummary012,153,"We were spotted by a Ganglion patrol team while
engaging a thallus. Looks like it's out of the frying pan
and into the furnace for us."
MultiQuestSummary013,153,"We've identified the Ganglion culprits who were using
xe-dom to stir up gravitational anomalies. Let's get out
there and bring their hijinks to an end!"
MultiQuestSummary014,153,
MultiQuestSummary015,153,
MultiQuestSummary016,153,"Clues pieced together from the Beasts' Lair have allowed
us to zero in on a Marnuck unit's current location.
These guys are seasoned fighters that tend to use
teamwork to their advantage, so stay alert!"
MultiQuestSummary017,153,"The unmanned craft were being remotely controlled by
an enemy outfit based in Sylvalum's Hilal Stronghold.
We're spread too thin to expend big resources here—
avoid Skells and take them out with a small, elite team."
MultiQuestSummary018,153,"A Sylooth couple is on a destructive rampage after a riling
scuffle among their kind. Neutralize the threat before the
entire forest is reduced to twigs! You'll find them north
of Tripod Rock, at the Great Nail!"
MultiQuestSummary019,153,
MultiQuestSummary020,153,"Looks like even fish that swim the skies have leaders.
While I'm sure you'd love to go land one, the adseculas
that swarm its lantern are what you really need to be
looking out for..."
MultiQuestSummary021,153,"Marnucks let a balaena and a scintimure they were
training escape, and now they're both running amok.
The area's roiling with storms and heat waves,
so be careful out there."
MultiQuestSummary022,153,"Uh-oh. Some vigents the Ganglion captured have broken
free. They're large, carnivorous, and extremely upset.
This is quite a present they've left for us, huh?
Time to go clean up the mess!"
MultiQuestSummary023,153,"Our Sylooth skirmish ticked off the leader-class resident
of the Canopied Nightwood, and now it's destroying
everything. Do something before our camp gets cratered!"
MultiQuestSummary024,153,"Though it was part of our visigel extermination effort,
attacking the cervus herd has angered its leader.
Unfortunately, conflict is our only option here."
MultiQuestSummary025,153,"We found a Ganglion facility conducting ether experiments
on live subjects. These foes are hardier than usual, so
engage with Skells and use Bind to make them vulnerable."
MultiQuestSummary026,153,"The Drongo Caravan gave us info about the auravis.
Though revered as the forest's protector, the beast is
merciless. Apparently, a saltat's dance has been known
to call it forth."
MultiQuestSummary027,153,"Though the murra is generally a symbiont to the levitath,
fluctuations in ether density have elicited volatile changes
in the latter's temperament. Defeat these frenzied beasts
before they attack our nearby camps!"
MultiQuestSummary028,153,"While the garrison was in an uproar, we confirmed that
Scabland Fortress launched several Qmoeva units with a
millepod in tow. We need you to sortie and neutralize
the threat immediately!"
MultiQuestSummary029,153,
MultiQuestSummary030,153,"Eradication of the cinicula has allowed an equally
ferocious species of indigen known as the ictus to flourish.
An ictus roars when it means business, so keep your ears
pricked. Try inflicting Topple to gain an advantage!"
MultiQuestSummary031,153,"Primordia is even more dangerous with hungry grexes on
the prowl, as starvation tends to amplify their ferocity.
Put them down before something bad happens."
MultiQuestSummary032,153,"Devil's Colony is now home to a new vesper leader,
and we need you to deal with the entire herd ASAP.
...Where in the heck did these critters come from?"
MultiQuestSummary033,153,"Emergency request from the Curators! A formidable species
of indigen known as the aeviter is holding up resource
transport. All nearby operatives are to respond at once."
MultiQuestSummary034,153,"There's been a recent spike in indigen pest numbers.
Perhaps it has to do with the toxic trees we dumped?
Regardless, we need someone to step in before the
ecosystem suffers."
MultiQuestSummary035,153,"The Ganglion's growing military might is limiting
Pathfinder activity in Cauldros. Take them down a
notch and help expand operations."
MultiQuestSummary036,153,"We dispatched troops to cull a poisonous indigen called
the papil, but they were attacked by a herd of supposedly
peaceful progen. Get out there and back them up."
MultiQuestSummary037,153,"Noctilum is a teeming showcase of natural wonder. But
for all the beauty, there are lots of concerns. If you stop to
smell the flowers, for example, they'll probably attack you!"
MultiQuestSummary038,153,"A Curator team overseeing food transport needs help
exterminating some pesky bugs. They specifically asked for
seasoned personnel, so it'll likely be a tough fight."
MultiQuestSummary039,153,"The camouflage on these indigens makes your jaw drop!
Just the other day, I thought I found a tasty mushroom,
but it turned into some sci-fi horror show before my eyes."
MultiQuestSummary040,153,"Our camps in Oblivia are under constant attack from a
group of highly coordinated indigens, and we think the
Marnucks are pulling their strings. Take them out."
MultiQuestSummary041,153,"This mission's objective is to destroy an autonomous
Ganglion mech. The enemy sure does seem to have
an inexhaustible cache of weapons, but we'll fix that
problem soon enough—one mission at a time."
MultiQuestSummary042,153,"We received an enigmatic report from a Pathfinder recon
team in Noctilum reading ""Shiny... Floaty..."" Head for the
transmission coordinates and get to the bottom of it."
MultiQuestSummary043,153,"The Ganglion have dispatched reconnaissance in force,
which we've decided to counter with some of our own.
Shut down their patrol routes and constrict operations."
MultiQuestSummary044,153,"The Noctilum camp is up to its ears in indigen pests.
Their numbers have exploded lately, though we've yet
to ascertain the cause. Taming this land is no easy task..."
MultiQuestSummary045,153,"Cinicula attacks on our field teams almost seem like they're
becoming...personal. Could the social capacities of Mira's
insects be much higher than initially thought?"
MultiQuestSummary046,153,"Regular reports from an operative on patrol suddenly
broke off without warning. Head to these coordinates
and verify the situation, would you? My gut's telling
me something's not right..."
MultiQuestSummary047,153,"Word from the Dorian Caravan is that large piscinoids
have been causing headaches in the area. Though there's
no immediate risk to New LA, we do have an obligation
to help, so get out there and purge those pests."
MultiQuestSummary048,153,"Angry indigens have overrun notable sites in Noctilum,
and are now interfering with Curator operations.
Take them down—and keep your dukes up!"
MultiQuestSummary049,153,"Our scanners have found a crucial White Whale
component in Cauldros's Old Ceremonial Hollow.
Eradicate any Ganglion interference there and
recover the debris right away."
MultiQuestSummary050,153,"We're planning to perform a distributional analysis of
ether using suids—an indigen that thrives across Mira.
Head to Noctilum and bag a few, would you?"
MultiQuestSummary051,153,"Plans to build a retreat area are in the works, but nasty
indigens are a problem. The mental serenity of the good
people of New LA rests on your magnanimous shoulders!"
MultiQuestSummary052,153,"There's been a surge in ether density at Lake Ciel.
We dispatched a team to investigate, but nearby indigens
are in an ether-fueled frenzy and won't let us approach."
MultiQuestSummary053,153,"Head to Cauldros and apprehend the puges roving the
area—their parts will prove as useful samples for Ganglion
tech analysis. Oh, and feel free to bust 'em up good—
even broken parts are still useful for research!"
MultiQuestSummary054,153,"Though the diet of the petramand is primarily composed
of minerals, some mutants with carnivorous tendencies
have appeared. Eliminate them to ensure the safety of
our Prospectors."
MultiQuestSummary055,153,"A team sent to thin germivore numbers reported some
unusually large specimens in Noctilum. We need you to
verify the sightings and neutralize the creatures in question."
MultiQuestSummary056,153,"All operatives—including any teams assigned to petramand
extermination—are to immediately set course for
Northpointe Cove and purge the inbound balaena threat."
MultiQuestSummary057,153,"A report came in reading ""Egg of evello is delicious new
Miran delicacy! It definitely much tastier than Nopon!""
...Oookay, then. Still, it seems to be describing a viable
new food source, so we should probably check it out."
MultiQuestSummary058,153,"A sleeping indigen has entrenched itself in the middle of a
crucial route to Oblivia, and our logistics guys can't budge
until you clear the road. Watch for attacks from below!"
MultiQuestSummary059,153,"A Curator researching suid infant-rearing angered a
mother suid while collecting samples. Get out there and
quell the threat before the situation escalates any further."
MultiQuestSummary060,153,"We uncovered a scirpo nest we'll need you to clear out.
Evidence suggests this is the handiwork of the enemy,
but just concentrate on the indigens for the time being."
MultiQuestSummary061,153,"Overhunting of aprica, who typically rule over the area,
has created an ecological ripple effect that attracted a
nasty type of indigen. Shoot it down and restore peace
to Mira's skies before it causes any more trouble."
MultiQuestSummary062,153,"We're getting Pathfinder reports of data probes in
Noctilum moving after being planted. Someone
had better get over there and verify the situation."
MultiQuestSummary063,153,"Marnuck hunting activity has begun displacing progen
herds and other wildlife, which could have detrimental
effects on nearby ecosystems. Go cull any out-of-place
herds you find before the situation gets out of control."
MultiQuestSummary064,153,"Terebra fur is highly sought after, which has led to
overhunting and an explosion in the saltat population.
It'd be a good idea to get out there and at least clear
out the more aggressive saltats ASAP."
MultiQuestSummary065,153,"Nearby indigens were angered when we tried to smoke a
dangerous insidia out of a treetop, and now they're on
the rampage. We need you to clean up our mess..."
MultiQuestSummary066,153,"Indigens have started going berserk in Noctilum, a possible
effect of toppling the tyrants there. We can't let the danger
ramp up further, so please intervene right away."
MultiQuestSummary067,153,"A rare species of vegetable was found growing in a
monoceros corpse in the sandseas of Sylvalum, and we
need a sample. Falsaxum are lurking in the vicinity,
so take care."
MultiQuestSummary068,153,"With its dinosaur-like physiology, the evello isn't quite like
flightless birds of Earth. It also doesn't like strangers,
which is hampering our work. Force is the only option."
MultiQuestSummary069,153,"A team dispatched to Sylvalum was decimated in a jacul
attack. Be careful—these indigens are feistier than most!"
MultiQuestSummary070,153,"Sylvalum is usually the only place you'd find mizaria
celery, but a specimen was recently located in Primordia.
Clear out nearby indigens so samples can be extracted."
MultiQuestSummary071,153,"The mortifole population in a prominent Nopon tourist
locale is spiking. With the Nopon Highroad nearby,
we've got to act quickly before any real damage occurs."
MultiQuestSummary072,153,"The North Coast is crawling with indigens, so make tracks
for Oblivia before the nearby camp is buried. If you take
out the leader—it's the largest one—the rest will scatter."
MultiQuestSummary073,153,"We're getting reports of a large petramand at the
waterfall west of New LA. No citizens have been
harmed as of yet—let's try and keep it that way."
MultiQuestSummary074,153,"A team engaging some simius had to pull out mid-battle
after sustaining damage from a flying boulder, believed
to be the work of a Sylooth. Neutralize the indigen
threat before our camps are flattened next."
MultiQuestSummary075,153,"The Ganglion are using Marnucks in one of their vile
machinations. Times like these demand that we move first!"
MultiQuestSummary076,153,"We need you to bring back a duoguill and lophid as part
of an initiative for exploring new indigen food options.
The future of New LA may be in your hands."
MultiQuestSummary077,153,"The potamus are an indigen species known for its
domestication by the Nopon. Wild specimens are quite
ornery, however, and uncontrollable once agitated..."
MultiQuestSummary078,153,"The ictus has learned to ambush our operatives from the
cover of spore clouds. Use the new weather-changing tech
to clear the spores and dispatch the indigens."
MultiQuestSummary079,153,"Though all Ganglion forces deserve caution, be especially
wary of the bloodthirsty Marnucks. The honed battle skills
of this race make them far more dangerous than most."
MultiQuestSummary080,153,"You are to neutralize a Ganglion Skell that has appeared
in the vicinity of New LA. There have also been reports of
rare and vicious indigens in the same area, so stay sharp."
MultiQuestSummary081,153,"One of our Harriers successfully infiltrated a Ganglion
base when some primordial-looking behemoths arrived
and trapped our man. Take down the giants and extract
the operative."
MultiQuestSummary082,153,"Camouflaged indigens are spreading like wildfire,
causing problems in King's Falls that we need you to
clean up. Go ahead and take care of the thalluses
and adseculas hiding out in the area."
MultiQuestSummary083,153,"Noctilucent spheres are an odd form of plant life dotting
Sylvalum—check them out and see what you can learn.
We've heard of xeno activity in the area, so be prepared."
MultiQuestSummary084,153,"A dangerous giant grex we've had on our threat list has
finally been lured out. The rest is up to you, operatives.
We expect your usual success!"
MultiQuestSummary085,153,"We located a Marnuck outfit toting resources for the
Ganglion. Take them out, but keep an eye on the skies—
there are reports of giant piscinoids roving the area."
MultiQuestSummary086,153,"There's a deadly dilus that needs taking out.
The creature in question is expected to show late at night,
so we'd like you to prepare for a strike then."
MultiQuestSummary087,153,"Salvaging a wrecked quo turned up some data about
indigens with enhanced ether channeling—the results of
Ganglion experiments. Take out the Ganglion troops
at the enclosed locale and get more data."
MultiQuestSummary088,153,"We've triangulated the location of some Skells the
Ganglion pilfered, and it seems Prone troops are already
giving them a test drive. Go destroy their new rides."
MultiQuestSummary089,153,"A group of mineral-corroding indigens has been sighted in
Primordia. It's possible they may latch onto New LA and
cause damage, so make sure that doesn't happen."
MultiQuestSummary090,153,"We've uncovered the habitat of a leader-class specimen
of turba that we need you to take out. Before you do,
however, make sure you first eliminate the unafulges
hiding in the lava, all right?"
MultiQuestSummary091,153,"We've detected a lone Sylooth wandering about. Leading
it away peacefully doesn't seem feasible, so take it out
before it stirs up the simius in the Canopied Nightwood."
MultiQuestSummary092,153,"The bloodthirsty Marnuck forces must be curbed!
We'll bait the small fry away by starting a diversion
outside the enemy fortress—use this window to strike."
MultiQuestSummary093,153,"An indigen problem is keeping us from exploring the
Silent Mire—one capable of swallowing an auravis whole,
to be exact. Take out the duoguill at the enclosed locale."
MultiQuestSummary094,153,"Following up the petramand mission, we need your help
taking out a large camouflaged indigen called the
arenatect. Try to avoid appendages and keep your
focus on the creature's main body."
MultiQuestSummary095,153,"Though we took out those Ganglion mechs, their support
crew at Jair Fortress is still alive and kicking.
This mission is going to change that."
MultiQuestSummary096,153,"The forfex, a creature which primarily thrives on shorelines,
was found over in Oblivia. Giant crabs in Oblivian
backcountry? Something's not right here."
MultiQuestSummary097,153,"Cross-referencing our test results of Silent Mire water with
New LA headwaters has revealed scirpo contamination.
Head to the headwaters and take it out."
MultiQuestSummary098,153,"A Harrier team near Mount M'gando needs backup,
as a jacul is giving them a run for their money.
We hear it's nasty, so you'd best prepare for the worst."
MultiQuestSummary099,153,"We're picking up a tyrant presence in Sylvalum that we
need you to eliminate. Failure to act will likely result in
a disruption of the area's ether balance."
MultiQuestSummary100,153,"A Harrier tasked to watch flightless birds was suddenly—
and ironically—attacked by flying fish. Get over there
and pop those piscinoids, would you?"
MultiQuestSummary101,153,"Studies of the caro species of indigen indicate Noctilum is
in danger of large-scale contamination from toxic agents.
Go there and make the area purgovent-free, would you?"
MultiQuestSummary102,153,"A leader-class grex attack resulted in some scintimures the
Outfitters had been keeping for research breaking loose.
Go put them down before they cause some real damage."
MultiQuestSummary103,153,"Reports of a wandering male virago have been coming in.
It likely lost a bid for the alpha position and was exiled
by the females of its group. Sounds like a bad day that's
about to get worse—we need you to take it out."
MultiQuestSummary104,153,"This mission is an assassination on a high-profile Ganglion
target in Sylvalum. It's a covert operation, so you'll have
to proceed on foot. No Skells allowed!"
MultiQuestSummary105,153,"A research team found a purgovent corpse with toxic
progen bones in its stomach. We traced them to a
contaminated progen herd—go contain the issue."
MultiQuestSummary106,153,"An indigen species with ant-like social aspects has been
discovered. Ecological damage is inevitable should their
population surge, so it's best to preemptively cull them."
MultiQuestSummary107,153,"We need you to bust some scirpos to fix a water-
contamination issue. Though not directly part of New LA's
infrastructure, the affected area is too close for comfort."
MultiQuestSummary108,153,"We've received a combat challenge from an unknown craft
whose pilot claims to be one of the ""Wrothian Four.""
Vandham said to take 'em on, so I guess that's that."
MultiQuestSummary109,153,"A group of cantors pursued by a Ganglion Skell unit
has struck back by going on a crazed rampage.
Looks like we're on janitorial duty for this one."
MultiQuestSummary110,153,"A team sent to secure a levitath specimen was ambushed
by Marnucks and decimated. This enemy is no pushover,
so go in fast and hit 'em hard."
MultiQuestSummary111,153,"Some hills on the outskirts of New LA are now home to
a group of rowdy simius. They've been attacking BLADE
transports, but fortunately, they cry out before striking,
giving us time to flee. I say it's time we stop running."
MultiQuestSummary112,153,"Some Mediators lost supplies to Marnuck raiders—and
we're suffering a commodity shortage as it is. If you
don't recover the cargo, I fear our days are numbered."
MultiQuestSummary113,153,"Some particularly feculent indigens have been congregating
in Oblivia. We fear this activity may give rise to new types
of contagions, so sanitize the problem before it gets ugly."
MultiQuestSummary114,153,"Some unmanned Ganglion recon craft were seen circling
near the Drongo Caravan. Put them on ice, but keep
one eye out for the nearby caro population."
MultiQuestSummary115,153,"An outfit of renegade Wrothians with no insignia has
begun a string of mindless attacks. Halt their spree
before our camps suffer any more casualties."
MultiQuestSummary116,153,"We need to wrest control of an important Cauldros water
source from the local indigens. They won't let go of it
easily, so expect some resistance."
MultiQuestSummary117,153,"Prone beast whisperers are said to use a special incense
to tame suids. It's a facinating topic, but...when your
mission is to wipe them out, that's what you do."
MultiQuestSummary118,153,"A remnant of the White Whale was located in Waterway
Tangle. Hostile indigens won't let the Reclaimers get close,
so you need to secure the area and inspect the wreckage."
MultiQuestSummary119,153,"A leader-class insidia has started to attack people—it must
have perceived our biosurvey team as a territorial threat.
This isn't a target we can take lightly, so use caution."
MultiQuestSummary120,153,"A scan of the New LA outskirts has revealed the presence
of a mid-sized Marnuck squad. Investigate their old
Beasts' Lair base to track their current location."
MultiQuestSummary121,153,"Neutralization of a tyrant has effected changes in the
neighboring indigen power structure. Specifically, a
leader-class auravis is posing a threat. You know the drill."
MultiQuestSummary122,153,"The area where we gathered those beaporges is unsafe;
reports now indicate that oc-servs are running rampant.
Oc-servs often fake being inoperative, so be cautious!"
MultiQuestSummary123,153,"A team in the field encountered a brutal scirpo that's even
larger than a dilus. They lacked the muscle to take it out,
but thankfully, we have you around."
MultiQuestSummary124,153,"A Harrier team engaged Ganglion hostiles in Noctilum,
forcing them to hole up in Cauldros. We need you to
enter their territory, smoke 'em out, and finish the job."
MultiQuestSummary125,153,"The appearance of those tyrants in Primordia caused
at least one cinicula to enter into a destructive frenzy.
Put it down before it leaves the continent in pieces."
MultiQuestSummary126,153,"Combat with a tyrant has displaced a herd of vivohasts.
They're on the move as we speak, so take them out
before they spark conflict with other indigens."
MultiQuestSummary127,153,"Toppling those Noctilum tyrants has left other indigens in a
state of unrest. We have an obligation to preserve order,
so pick up these loose ends, would you?"
MultiQuestSummary128,153,"Our pursuit of a defeated tyrant that fled the scene
led us straight into a Ganglion camp! If we're to continue
pursuing the beast, we'll need to take out the Ganglion
here first. You know what to do!"
MultiQuestSummary129,153,"Taking down those petrimand tyrants inadvertently cheated
a Ganglion Seidr out of his prey. You can guess who
he'll be hunting next, I assume? Take him out, too!"
MultiQuestSummary130,153,"Multiple cargo containers were taken into a Ganglion
fortress in Cauldros. Penetrate the enemy's territory and
see if you can find one so we can learn a bit about
this mystery freight."
MultiQuestSummary131,153,"Camouflaged indigens are giving the Curators a hard time
assessing plant distribution in Oblivia. Go over there and
clear out the problematic fauna."
MultiQuestSummary132,153,"Some Curators were gathering edible plants outside
New LA and unwittingly ravished a suid feeding
ground—sending their Prone keepers into a rage."
MultiQuestSummary133,153,"We managed to pinpoint the headquarters of some
Ganglion forces that have been squatting in our orchards.
Cripple their base so we can start harvesting fruit again."
MultiQuestSummary134,153,"A Curator collecting a poisonous species of plant known
as jaharmum fell victim to an angry caecus herd.
Apparently, these creatures don't like sharing food."
MultiQuestSummary135,153,"A Curator tasked with finding joadtanks stumbled onto a
levitath. Unfortunately, it's at the Divine Roost, so the
levitath is going to be the least of your worries..."
MultiQuestSummary136,153,"Winning back our orchards from the Ganglion wasn't
enough—now a fruit-loving avian species is showing up,
though only during certain weather conditions.
Go clip their wings."

in blatta population confirmed—including the giant ones.""
...Yeesh. Everyone hates bugs, don't you think?"
MultiQuestSummary159,153,"A herd of viragoes in Noctilum are displaying territorial
aggression towards mission operatives. They're leaving us
with no choice but to take them out."
MultiQuestSummary160,153,"A group of parasitic visigels has been sighted, and a
nearby herd of cervuses has already fallen victim.
Put them down before things get worse."
MultiQuestSummary161,153,"The instant Jia Mian, the Beloved bit the dust, we detected
a massive Ganglion Skell making a beeline for the target
area. Intercept the revenge-oriented pilot and destroy it."
MultiQuestSummary162,153,"The brambloo shoots we found were being transported by
the Drongo Caravan until they became the target of a
Ganglion raid. It seems we've fanned the flames of war..."
MultiQuestSummary163,153,"A transport team moving a progen specimen was attacked
by a virago—and an extremely fierce one at that.
They're requesting immediate assistance."
MultiQuestSummary164,153,"A vigent separated from its group is wandering Oblivia in

Battlegrounds. Head there and extract the survivors."

mid-mission, sparking a battle they had to retreat from.
The viragoes are in a hostile state, so go secure the area."

MultiQuestSummary169,153,"The Ganglion's defensive gun batteries are no more, but
they still retain air supremacy. Down their squad of drone
fighters and regain control of Oblivia's skies."
MultiQuestSummary170,153,"A virago had a hostile run-in with a xiphias,
causing the latter to run amok and terrorize the area.
Engage the xiphias ASAP and contain the chaos."
MultiQuestSummary171,153,"Multiple unmanned Ganglion drones are being deployed
in Cauldros as we speak. We can't allow the enemy to
further bolster its forces, so go hit the enemy base."
MultiQuestSummary172,153,"A peculiar discovery was made on Great Washington
Isle—a stockpile of aprica horns, likely the trophies of a
Ganglion hunting unit. Get over there and dismantle it."
MultiQuestSummary173,153,"For this mission, we need you to take down a Sylooth.
This creature and its entourage are a walking den of
hostility, so be on your guard."
MultiQuestSummary174,153,"Operatives were incinerating tectinsula spores when they
were attacked by a sphinx. Sphinxes base superiority
on flame-breathing contests, so it likely felt challenged."
MultiQuestSummary175,153,"The gravitational anomalies caused by the xe-dom have
inadvertently sent some filiavents on a destructive binge.
They will strip the land bare if we don't act fast."
MultiQuestSummary176,153,"Ready to put the boot to some Ganglion? The enemy
has deployed a formidable platoon in a nearby segment,
crippling a supply route. End them and retake control."
MultiQuestSummary177,153,"The Ganglion unit responsible for aprica overhunting has
been pushed back to their base in the New LA vicinity.
Let's take them out before they can restock and regroup."
MultiQuestSummary178,153,"Multiple indigens are rampaging in Noctilum.
The initial cause seems to be a virago which ingested
a poisonous species of mushroom, causing it to
become disoriented and frantic."
MultiQuestSummary179,153,"A Gularth rampage is underway in Cauldros due to
constant brimstone showers. We can't wait for the
weather to clear up for good—go there and take out
the targets while we have an opening."
MultiQuestSummary180,153,"We locked down the location of a Ganglion Skell squad
just outside New LA that was apparently hunting vigents.
Let's turn the tables and make them the hunted."
MultiQuestSummary181,153,"We assigned a team to track down a Ganglion unit of
jumbo-sized Skells, but dangerous indigens are hindering
the search. Clear them out."
MultiQuestSummary182,153,"We've had reports of an indigen herd entrenched near a
colossal noctilucent sphere. They're attacking anything that
approaches—almost as if afraid of something."
MultiQuestSummary183,153,"Colubrim alert! The beast is currently on the move and
leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. It's currently
passing over Mount M'gando—see that it doesn't leave."
MultiQuestSummary184,153,"Data pertaining to a Ganglion drone test lab was
extracted from a downed Gularth. This is a chance we
can't pass up—infiltrate the lab and report your findings."
MultiQuestSummary185,153,"Here are the coordinates of a Ganglion outfit we pulled
from a wrecked Skell. The target is a mid-sized squad
with several support units in tow, so be ready."
MultiQuestSummary186,153,"Nopon parents curb their children's hoarding with a tale
that says picking five myuena cacti will summon a scary
dragon. Who knew a sabula would actually appear?"

MultiQuestSummary201,153,"An ultrafauna for which we've had previous reports has
begun attacking Ganglion, humans, and other elements
foreign to this world. We must prepare a full-scale assault!
[ST:col p1=red ]All operatives, report! A Global Nemesis draws near!"
MultiQuestSummary202,153,
MultiQuestSummary203,153,"BLADE efforts to reduce the number of threatening
indigens are going well, but in the process, they've also
inadvertently given rise to a foe that threatens us all.

MultiQuestSummary204,153,"This virtual training program was compiled using your
captured combat data. The BLADE ethos encourages a
rigorous training regimen, so practice up, operatives!"
MultiQuestSummary205,153,"Care to practice fighting the infernal tainted sphinx?
As this beast's abilities are among the highest of all
indigens on Mira, you might benefit from a round
or two of sparring..."
MultiQuestSummary206,153,"This program will allow you to engage a pair of
Ganglion agents in virtual combat—foes you might
remember from a past encounter..."
MultiQuestSummary207,153,"This is incredible! Thanks to you, we now have the
Wrothian prince Ga Jiarg's combat data on file.
This will let operatives polish their skills even further."
MultiQuestSummary208,153,"This program will pit you against a Skell, the signature
BLADE weapon. And not just any Skell, either. I'll let
you guess whose combat data you'll be up against..."
MultiQuestSummary209,153,"The Vita is an amalgam of high-level tech our civilization
normally wouldn't even dream of, let alone reproduce.
Thanks to its pilot, we've been able to compile combat
data, though this facsimile isn't as strong as the real thing."
MultiQuestSummary210,153,
MultiQuestSummary211,153,
MultiQuestSummary212,153,"This program pits you against a pair of unidentified Skells.
The source, time period, and location of the original data
is unknown due to the supplier's bogus ID."
MultiQuestSummary213,153,"This is the combat data of a craft piloted by one who
exhibited great animosity—or more like a mad obession—
towards us. Its strength seems to have been exaggerated
due to the fear of the operative who engaged it."
DLCQuestSummary001,153,"There's trouble brewing in Sylvalum with a group of ovis.
Though the ovis are generally docile, we have orders to
eliminate all potentially dangerous herds."

heading their mechanized battalion. The area is crawling
with indigens, so concentrate on the target for victory."
DLCQuestSummary003,153,"Those pesky Prone are now trying to domesticate
auravises. The idea sounds like a long shot on paper,
but we can't risk them succeeding. See that they don't."
DLCQuestSummary004,153,"A terminal dropped by a Prone was found to contain data
describing experiments to tame giant piscinoids. Though
the notion is far-fetched, we can't let it come to fruition."
DLCQuestSummary005,153,"Nights abounding with absop's swallowtails are said to
signify levitath mating—and too many of those can ruin
Noctilum's ether balance. We need your help here."
DLCQuestSummary006,153,"A cloud-like mass of turbas are sailing over Sylvalum.
The Harriers can't dent these numbers, so we need a
small group to clear the area around the turbas' nest
so we can send a team in to eliminate the queen."

which signals the birth of a Gularth in Sunset Falls.
Take out the creature before it can pose a threat to us."
DLCQuestSummary008,153,"We received a report of some ""living drills"" in Primordia,
fairly close to New LA. One can only hope this is all
just a big misunderstanding..."
DLCQuestSummary009,153,"A Ganglion mech squad's commander has been tracked to
Oblivia. He doesn't seem to be equipped with a Skell or
other large weaponry at the moment, so go take him out!"
DLCQuestSummary010,153,"Saltat relationships are grounded in dancing, but what
does that mean for species like the scirpo and dilus?
Whatever the answer, it seems we've got a sticky
dilemma on our hands..."
DLCQuestSummary011,153,"This one's from the Prospectors—apparently there were
useful supplies mixed into a recently discarded batch
of junk. Go track them down before the Ganglion can."

where they stumbled onto a Ganglion base."

and a herd recently unearthed a xe-dom in Sylvalum.
They often feign being inoperative, so don't be fooled."
DLCQuestSummary018,153,"The Ganglion are utilizing falsaxum as natural traps by
dousing the creatures in water to jolt them out of sleep.
